# Enriching Crops
#### A simple ML  based website which recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use for your crops.




## DATA SOURCE üìä
- [Crop recommendation dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) (custom built dataset)
- [Fertilizer suggestion dataset](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv) (custom built dataset)

## Notebooks üìì
##### I have also published the corresponding code on Kaggle Notebooks.
- [Crop Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/what-crop-to-grow)
- [Disease Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/plant-disease-classification-resnet-99-2)

## DEPLOYMENT üöÄ

#### This website is deployed at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
#### Note: The website may take a minute to load sometimes, as the server may be in hibernate state

## How to use 
- Crop Recommendation system ==> enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. Refer [this website](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/fertilizer-numbers-npk.htm) for more information.
Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) from where humidity, temperature data is fetched.

- Fertilizer suggestion system ==> Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.

Note that, for now it only supports following crops
